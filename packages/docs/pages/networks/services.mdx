# Services and Infrastructure
The Namada mainnet and testnet are supplemented by a variety of services and infrastructure that improve the UX of interacting with the blockchain.
These include:
- RPC: a node used to query the blockchain directly.
- Namada Indexer: a filtered database off-chain that stores information in useful forms for common queries.
- MASP Indexer: a database off-chain for shielded pool transactions that allows for optimized syncing that is needed to query or transact in the shieled pool.
- Namadillo: a front-end user interface for transacting on-chain
- Block Explorer: a web interface for discovering information about the current state of the blockchain

### Accessing services
Many teams contribute to the support and maintenance of these services, including Heliax, which operates production-grade instances of each of these services.
The Heliax public endpoints for infra are:

Furthermore, there are several places to discover other community-run infra and services.
The current primary base is on [namada.community](https://namada.community/infrastructure-services), which pulls its data from the [namada-ecosystem github repo](https://github.com/Luminara-Hub/namada-ecosystem/tree/main/user-and-dev-tools).
This is an actively maintained resource for finding active IBC relayers, RPC providers, Namadillo front-end instances, active indexers, state snapshot providers and more.

Other block explorers and Namadillo instances can also be found on https://namada.net/apps as well.
